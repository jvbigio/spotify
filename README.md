# Summary

This application utilizes Twitter's API to fetch Tweets. Users can search for a Tweet by a specific topic or by a Twitter username. Additionally, by clicking on a Twitter profile on the Random page, users can generate a random Tweet from any of the five Twitter profiles.

Twitter's API is handled via a Node server, with React handling the frontend.

Building this app was loads of fun and had several challenges along the way! Some of these challenges included working with authentication, error handling, and manipulating Twitter's data.

I look forward to adding more features, so stay tuned for more!
